title: "Staying up to date with Javascript Ecosystem"
---

Javascript is a very popular language, and so, there are hundreds of new projects being developed every day and it's really hard, maybe impossible to keep track of what's going on in the field. A novice in this ecosystem of ever-changing moving parts can easily get confused and discouraged.

In this article, I will share some of the ways I stay up to date with the Javascript ecosystem. You can always use similar methods to stay up to date with any topic or trend on the internet.

# Newsletters

Newsletters are one of the best ways to stay up to date with an ecosystem. Newsletters are weekly, or monthly emails sent to the subscribers with curated links of popular work, tutorials, opinions and new releases of software.

Here are some of the newsletters that I follow to stay up to date with web development and javascript ecosystem:

- [Javascript Weekly](https://javascriptweekly.com/)
- [Node Weekly](https://nodeweekly.com/)
- [Oâ€™Reilly Web Newsletter](https://www.oreilly.com/web-platform/newsletter.html)
- [ES.next News](http://esnextnews.com/)

# Blogs

Blogs are one of the best ways to find large amounts of useful knowledge from experience, gracefully archived for your consumption! Try to subscribe to RSS feeds of popular blogs in the ecosystem. Most of the blogs should support RSS feeds so you can use a software like [Thunderbird](https://www.thunderbird.net/en-US/) to subscribe to those blogs and receive latest posts.

Some of the popular blogs that I follow in the javascript ecosystem:

- [2ality](http://2ality.com/index.html)
- [CSS-Tricks](https://css-tricks.com/)

# Reddit

Reddit has a lot of communities related to javascript and popular libraries. These communities share links to interesting projects, and news in the industry ranked based on their importance/relevance etc. You can say it's newsletters but more dynamic and changing from day to day!

Some of the popular javascript-based communities in Reddit:

- [/r/javascript](https://reddit.com/r/javascript/")
- [/r/node](https://www.reddit.com/r/node/)
- [/r/Frontend](https://www.reddit.com/r/Frontend/)
- [/r/webdev](https://www.reddit.com/r/webdev/)
- [/r/learnjavascript](https://www.reddit.com/r/learnjavascript/)

# Twitter

Twitter is another great place to find insights and news about the latest and the cutting edge work in the ecosystem. Following popular developers and contributors in the industry gives you a glimpse of new trends and work being done in the industry, inspiration, and support. It is also one of the best ways to get in contact with these awesome developers and seek advice or contribute to the discussions.

Some of the popular developers I follow in the javascript ecosystem are:
